# datascience_projects

This repository contains two projects of supervised classification:
The first one is a credit scoring prediction problem for a bank. This school project (M2 diderot) is based on real data.

Let's briefly explain the structure:
- notebook contains the code (in ipynb and pdf)
- octroi_RCI.csv = the clients data
- visual_presentation.pdf = the final pwp presentation that we made at the end of the challenge

The second one is a customer satisfaction score prediction. The structure is similar:
- notebook.ipynb (the code)
- report = the detailed report of the project
- visual_presentation.pdf = a pwp for an more visual presentation
